# Standard 41 Surprise Minor Practice
This is a little project to create a tool to help with people learning to ring 
the 'Standard 41' Surprise Minor methods. Hopefully it is useful.

The current results are published at: http://bobwallis.github.io/Standard41/

## Developing
This repository includes files to create a [development container for use in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), 
which is the easiest way to get started. Pull the source code off Github, open 
the folder in a development container, run `gulp watch` to automatically 
recompile any changes to source code, and then open `./dist/index.html` in a 
web browser.
